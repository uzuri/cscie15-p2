# CSCI E-15 P2 Rebecca Mazur

[Live Location](http://p2.cscie15.theredsetter.com)

Quick and dirty XKCD password gen built on /usr/share/dict/words; should be fairly portable.  Note: this project does not filter words, so expect weird combos now and again.  Basic error checking included, though it may not be immediately obvious due to the use of the HTML5 number input type.  Radio buttons assume that any input other than 1 is false rather than throwing a visible error.

Will hold settings from submission to submission (though not if you leave the page; no cookies or anything like that).

[Jing Screencast](http://screencast.com/t/wPb1IhfEdQ3) -- I hope this is working correctly; I found Jing a little difficult to use.
